# Assailant-s-mailer-
a mailer to send emails including messages, subjects, multiple attachments and to multiple receivers.
I have used a package named nodemailer with OAuth2 authentication for sending mails, and also used multer for uploading the attachments and used cloudinary for storing all my sent attachments.
I have also plans of creating a history tab along with this.
